## Listings ↔ areas (live content)

`listings` is fetcher-written live content (Supabase only, never git-synced; see
`docs/SUPABASE_SYNC.md`). Two complementary columns/tables tie a listing to areas:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `listings.area_id` | The **primary** area — **DERIVED from `listing_areas.is_primary` since 2026-07-01** (migration `derived_primary_from_listing_areas`): the `replace_listing_areas` RPC updates it in the same transaction as every membership write, so it can never drift. Still the single named/nearest village (address tiebreak in `withinGeofence`); consumed by `page-property.js` and `page-listings.js`. **Do not drop, repurpose, or write directly — write membership.** |
| `listing_areas` (m2m) | The **full membership set** — one row per area whose geofence *contains* the listing (`rightmove_id`, `area_id`, `distance_mi`, `is_primary`). Exactly one `is_primary=true` row per non-empty set — enforced structurally (`uniq_listing_areas_primary` partial unique index + RPC boundary validation, 2026-07-01) — and `listings.area_id` is derived from it. Live content (service-role write, public read). |

Village geofences **overlap**, so a listing can sit inside several areas at once. The feed
scopes to a household's areas via `listing_areas` membership (filter by `rightmove_id`), NOT the
single `area_id` — so a listing physically inside an area you hold is visible even when its
primary is one you don't. Writers: both `tools/fetch-listings.mjs` and
`tools/import-apify-runs.mjs` emit membership from `withinGeofence().areas` via the
`replace_listing_areas` RPC; `tools/backfill-listing-areas.mjs` seeded existing rows.

**One visibility predicate (2026-07-01):** the `household_feed(p_household_id, …)` SECURITY
DEFINER RPC owns the whole per-household rule in one place — membership ∩ active
areas ∩ curated-disable ∩ `geofence_pass` ∩ baseline, ordered + paged, with the full membership
set attached as `areas` jsonb. Contract: `supabase/archive/schema-household-feed.sql` +
`tests/contract/household-feed.test.js` (fixture reference implementation:
`tests/mocks/household-feed-rpc.js`). The storage feed read is pointed at it in step 2.13.

**Origin areas — RETIRED (2026-07-09, ADR 0009):** the `is_origin` home/commute-anchor
carve-out (2026-07-01 → 2026-07-09) was removed by owner directive as a never-intended
feature. The column is dropped, the RPC and fetcher no longer read it, and the picker's
"Home" toggle is gone: **every active household area is a target** — the only per-area
feed/fetch switch is the reversible pause (`status: active|inactive`).

### The visibility contract — every way a listing can be absent or hidden (2026-07-09 audit)

**Invariant: a listing may only be invisible for a reason on this list.** Anything else is a
bug — and it is checked mechanically, not by trust: `tools/audit-listing-coverage.mjs`
(run nightly with `--fix` by `.github/workflows/coverage-sentinel.yml`, red run = violation)
re-derives membership from coordinates, reconciles every `listings` row into exactly one
bucket per household, and fails on any UNEXPLAINED residue.

*Never fetched (absent from the DB):*
1. **Not near any active area** — only areas in the demand set (≥1 active household link) are
   searched, each within its search radius. **The drawn map ring is the radius FLOOR
   (ADR 0010, 2026-07-10):** a learned/tuned radius may only widen the search + membership
   scope relative to the ring; only a user-applied tighten (which moves the ring in the same
   action) may narrow it. Enforced write-side (`planRadii`), read-side (`applyRadiusTuning`)
   and by the nightly sentinel's ring-aware drift check.
2. **Outside the scraped price band** — searches run at the household-budget union band
   (currently min £300k); cheaper listings are never fetched even though the feed would show
   them. Known trade-off — widen a budget to widen the band.
3. **Search-source filters** — houses/bungalows only, the household union beds floor
   (lowest criteria `size.minBeds`, baseline 2), and the text-match new-build drop (owner
   decision 2026-06-04) apply at source.
4. **Per-target result cap** — 200 results/search; a capped page now logs a loud
   `⚠ TRUNCATED` warning naming the target (2026-07-09).
5. **Recency window** — scheduled runs only see listings added in the last ~day; standing
   stock needs a FOUNDATION_MODE pull (recency filter omitted = all live stock;
   `foundation-rural-thin.yml` covers the rural thin tail).

*Fetched but not in the feed (in the DB, named bucket):*
6. **`archived_at` set** — purge/archival with a recorded `archive_reason`; revealable via
   `p_include_archived`.
7. **No membership in one of YOUR active areas** — paused links, other households' areas.
8. **`geofence_pass=false`** — outside every buffer; revealable via "out of area" toggle.
9. **Baseline in the RPC** — excluded type / off-band KNOWN price / under-beds (unknown
   values always pass).

*In the feed but hidden client-side (each has a visible count + reveal):*
10. **Affordability gate / junk (auction, over-55) / confirmed refinement hides** — "Show
    hidden" reveals all three; counts in the feed summary. The radius pre-filter is
    MEMBERSHIP-AWARE (2026-07-10): a listing passes if it sits inside ANY member area's
    ring (`makeRadiusFilter`, shared by Browse + the dashboard count), never hidden by its
    primary area's distance alone.
11. **Decided suppression** — liked → Saved page, passed/rejected → Rejected page (by id AND
    property fingerprint so re-lists stay decided); never silently gone, always on a page.
12. **Fingerprint dedupe** — same physical property collapses to one representative (counted).

**Retired/forbidden mechanisms:** `is_origin` (ADR 0009); **autonomous radius shrink below
the drawn ring** (ADR 0010 — the 2026-07-10 audit found the learner had silently shrunk four
active areas to 0.76–2.87 mi under 3 mi rings, hiding 567 in-DB listings; tightens are now
suggestion-only below the ring); learned `dropAreas`/`dropOutcodes` narrowing only runs with
`USE_LEARNED=1`, which no workflow sets; `scrape_probation` is user-driven pause, currently
empty. Membership drift from AREA_IDS-scoped runs (the bug that hid whole catchments' worth
of junction rows) was fixed 2026-07-09 — the geofence index is frozen before the search scope
is applied — and the sentinel self-heals any residue nightly.

### Listing lifecycle (audited + pinned, step 2.18)

`listings.status` ∈ `live | under_offer | sstc | withdrawn` — stamped by
`mapStatus()` (`tools/listings-normalise.mjs`) from the source's free-text status at
normalise-time and refreshed on every re-sight via the UPSERT. **Nothing else writes it**
(personal statuses — new/saved/viewed/offered/rejected — live on `shortlist`, never here).
A delisted property simply stops being re-seen: its `status`/`last_seen` freeze and it ages
into the purge. Out-of-buffer rows (`geofence_pass=false`, stored-but-hidden) are never
re-upserted by the fetcher (it writes in-buffer only), so they age out the same way.

`tools/purge-listings.mjs` (dry-run by default; `APPLY=1` deletes) removes, in order —
ever-**liked** rows are unconditionally protected first: (a) `baseline` violations
(`passesBaseline`, the shared gate), (b) `rejected-stale` (current reaction = reject, by id
OR fingerprint so relists count, unseen > `REJECT_HALF_LIFE_DAYS`=14), (c) `stale` (unseen >
`STALE_DAYS`=30, catches delisted/withdrawn). `PURGE_REASONS` is the **complete** reason set
(pinned by `tests/unit/purge-listings.test.js` — an undocumented drive-by reason once
crashed the tool). Each purged listing's `listing_areas` rows are deleted alongside it (no
FK — junction hygiene, also pinned); the reject signal survives forever in the append-only
`listing_reactions` log, so suppression outlives the purged row.
